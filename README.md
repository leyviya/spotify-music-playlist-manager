# Spotify Music Playlist Manager / Generator

In this Python Project, my aim is to develop a “Music Playlist Generator” rather than manager.           
Spotify does a great job at providing us with many (and always fresh) playlists,to the point that it is basically 100% guaranteed that it satisfies us on any occasion. 
But, sometimes it is also lots of fun to generate our own playlists,according to whatever criteria we can think of.  
My project is about a simple Python application to create custom Spotify playlists using the Spotify Web API,based on seed tracks.

P.S
You should have an active spotify account in order to download & run the codes and implement the project.
